Give examples of algorithms with following time complexities:
a. O(1)      = Adding an element in front of LL
b. O(N)      = Finding an element in unsorted array
c. O(log N)  = Finding an element in sorted array
d. O(N logN) = Merge Sort
e. O(MN)     = Multiplication of array
f. O(N^2)    = Shortest path between 2 nodes in graph
g. O(N^3)    = Matrix Multiplication
